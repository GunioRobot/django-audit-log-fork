The setup script for this package requires setuptools, you can
download and run the script from here:

If you want to install the development version, check out the code from
the mercurial repository
 
    hg clone https://django-audit-log.googlecode.com/hg/ django-audit-log 
 
cd into the django-audit-log directory and run:
	
	python setup.py develop

that will just make a link in your site-packages folder pointing to where 
you cloned the project. At this point you can use it or hack on the code if you
wish.

To install it you can run:

	python setup.py install
